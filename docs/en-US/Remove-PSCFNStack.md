# Remove-PSCFNStack

## SYNOPSIS
Calls the AWS CloudFormation DeleteStack API operation.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-PSCFNStack [-RetainResource <String[]>] [-ClientRequestToken <String>] [-Force] [-PassThru]
 [-RoleARN <String>] [-StackName] <String> [-AccessKey <String>] [-Credential <AWSCredentials>]
 [-EndpointUrl <String>] [-NetworkCredential <PSCredential>] [-ProfileLocation <String>]
 [-ProfileName <String>] [-Region <Object>] [-S3EndpointUrl <String>] [-SecretKey <String>]
 [-SessionToken <String>] [-STSEndpointUrl <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Deletes a specified stack.
The call does not return until the stack deletion has completed unless -PassThru is present, in which case it returns immediately and you can check the status of the stack via the DescribeStacks API Stack events for this template and any nested stacks are output to the console.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
Remove-PSFNStack -StackName my-stack
```

Deletes the specified stack

### EXAMPLE 2
```
Remove-PSFNStack -StackName my-stack -PassThru
```

Deletes the specified stack.
Don't wait for the deletion to complete.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
Remove-PSFNStack -StackName my-stack -RetainResource my-bucket, my-security-group
```

Deletes the specified stack, retaining the specified resources.

Note that the listed resources will only be retained if, and only if the stack is in a DELETE_FAILED state and the listed resources are the cause of the failure.
IF the stack is not DELETE_FAILED, you will be asked if you want to proceed with the delete and if you answer yes, then ALL resources will be deleted.

## PARAMETERS

### -RetainResource
For stacks in the DELETE_FAILED state, a list of resource logical IDs that are associated with the resources you want to retain.
During deletion, AWS CloudFormation deletes the stack but does not delete the retained resources.
Retaining resources is useful when you cannot delete a resource, such as a non-empty S3 bucket, but you want to delete the stack.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: RetainResources

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ClientRequestToken
A unique identifier for this CreateStack request.
Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create a stack with the same name.
You might retry CreateStack requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.
All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations.
For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1.
In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab.
Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation .
For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
This parameter overrides confirmation prompts to force the cmdlet to continue its operation.
This parameter should always be used with caution.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PassThru
If this is set, then the operation returns immediately after submitting the request to CloudFormation.
If not set, then the operation is followed to completion, with stack events being output to the console.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RoleARN
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to create the stack.
AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.
AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack.
As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it.
Ensure that the role grants least privilege.If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack.
If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -StackName
The name that is associated with the stack.
The name must be unique in the Region in which you are creating the stack.A stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case sensitive) and hyphens.
It must start with an alphabetic character and cannot be longer than 128 characters.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AccessKey
The AWS access key for the user account.
This can be a temporary access key if the corresponding session token is supplied to the -SessionToken parameter.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: AK

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential
An AWSCredentials object instance containing access and secret key information, and optionally a token for session-based credentials.

```yaml
Type: AWSCredentials
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EndpointUrl
The endpoint to make CloudFormation calls against.

The cmdlets normally determine which endpoint to call based on the region specified to the -Region parameter or set as default in the shell (via Set-DefaultAWSRegion).
Only specify this parameter if you must direct the call to a specific custom endpoint, e.g.
if using LocalStack or some other AWS emulator or a VPC endpoint from an EC2 instance.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NetworkCredential
Used with SAML-based authentication when ProfileName references a SAML role profile.
Contains the network credentials to be supplied during authentication with the configured identity provider's endpoint.
This parameter is not required if the user's default network identity can or should be used during authentication.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ProfileLocation
Used to specify the name and location of the ini-format credential file (shared with the AWS CLI and other AWS SDKs)

If this optional parameter is omitted this cmdlet will search the encrypted credential file used by the AWS SDK for .NET and AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio first.
If the profile is not found then the cmdlet will search in the ini-format credential file at the default location: (user's home directory)\.aws\credentials.

If this parameter is specified then this cmdlet will only search the ini-format credential file at the location given.

As the current folder can vary in a shell or during script execution it is advised that you use specify a fully qualified path instead of a relative path.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: AWSProfilesLocation, ProfilesLocation

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ProfileName
The user-defined name of an AWS credentials or SAML-based role profile containing credential information.
The profile is expected to be found in the secure credential file shared with the AWS SDK for .NET and AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio.
You can also specify the name of a profile stored in the .ini-format credential file used with the AWS CLI and other AWS SDKs.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: StoredCredentials, AWSProfileName

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

Aliases: RegionToCall

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -S3EndpointUrl

S3 is used by these cmdlets for managing S3 based templates and by the packager for uploading code artifacts and nested templates.

The cmdlets normally determine which endpoint to call based on the region specified to the -Region parameter or set as default in the shell (via Set-DefaultAWSRegion).
Only specify this parameter if you must direct the call to a specific custom endpoint, e.g.
if using LocalStack or some other AWS emulator or a VPC endpoint from an EC2 instance.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SecretKey
The AWS secret key for the user account.
This can be a temporary secret key if the corresponding session token is supplied to the -SessionToken parameter.

```yaml
